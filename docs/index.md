# caridea/session

üç§ Caridea is a miniscule PHP application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is the session component. It's used for controlling sessions (e.g. starting, resuming, destroying) as well as storing namespaced values within a session.
