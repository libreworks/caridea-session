# caridea-session
Caridea is a miniscule PHP web application library. This shrimpy fellow is what you'd use when you just want some helping hands and not a full-blown framework.

This is the session component. It's used for controlling sessions (e.g. starting, resuming, destroying) as well as storing namespaced values within a session.

It supports plugins that get notified of session events. Included in this package are a CSRF prevention plugin and a "flash message" plugin.
